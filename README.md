# Python Interpreter
This is a minimal implementation of a Python interpreter in Python.

This project was created as a self-educational workshop to better understand the mechanics behind Python.

This was created by following the tutorial and instructions contained in Allison Kaptur's wonderful article:
(A Python Interpreter Written in Python)[http://www.aosabook.org/en/500L/a-python-interpreter-written-in-python.html]
